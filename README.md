imAnimTabber
============

An upside-down tabbing interface

This plugin was based upon the imUpSideDownTabber that I created a few months ago. The imUpSideDownTabber is a tabbed interface that displays tabs underneath the content. Much of the functionality for this new plugin is the same as the imUpSideDownTabber, but I decided to rename it because it does more than just up-side-down tabbing. This tabbing plugin can be used to display content with the following animated options:

slide (imUpsideDownTabber) height width fade carousel

As with the imUpSideDownTabber, the tabs can be created dynamically, but I added a ‘manual’ mode so that the imAnimTabber plugin can function when the tabbing interface is already created. Unlike the imUpSideDownTabber, the tabs can be individually styled. Also, unlike imUpSideDownTabber, I created a true demo page.
